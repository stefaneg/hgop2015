# Day 4

Get a test report displayed in Jenkins for tests run in Karma. 
Using [Karma JUnit Reporter](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-junit-reporter) should do the trick.

Start preparing for implementing unit tests for a tic-tac-toe server by collecting examples
using an event based approach. See lecture.

- Consider failure (illegal move) scenarios. Do not trust the clients to always do the right things in the right order.
- Consider winning scenarios. Hint: There are at least three winning scenarios that must be considered from
a programming perspective.
- Consider draw scenarios.
 
Note that this is a thinking tool at this point - NOT a specification tool. We'll translate to specifications
when writing the tests for this.

Create a new md file called testExamples.md where you collect your examples and put in your project root.
